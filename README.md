# A Dating Sim Engine!

Have you ever wanted:
- To live out your wildest erotic fantasises without the mess of having to actually talk to people?
- To date a real fake anime girl?

Then you may be interested in this dating sim, written in Common Lisp.

## Plan
The idea is rather simple -- a simple parser will read a dating sim file to get data (character names, scripts, etc) on that scenario, and run that script for the user.

I'll probably implement some saving functionality later
